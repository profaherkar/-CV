                    </h2>
                    <p>I am a <a href = "https://www.highworth.kent.sch.uk/">student</a>, <a href = "www.xfstudy.wordpress.com">entrepreneur</a> and <a href - "">writer</a>. I'm a very confident individual and aspire to go above and beyond in all situations. In addition to my nine core GCSEs I undertook Classical Civilisation and the Free-Standing Maths Qualification, both studied in lunchtimes and after-school sessions, completing CC in 1 year. I completed my silver DofE to focus on developing my skills in guitar and fitness in football, as well as to enjoy a three-day hike with fellow participants in the unknown countryside. Iâ€™ve also volunteered for <a data-scroll="data-scroll" href="#Work Experience">multiple charities</a> over the past few years developing skills such as leadership, teamwork and confidence. In addition to this, I have had the opportunity to spend time in a <a href = "https://www.east-stour.kent.sch.uk/">primary school</a>, working with children; which has enabled me to communicate on different levels. This in turn has increased my confidence in the workplace and amplified my courage to try new things. I always aspire to do my best and persuade others to put in their all and love to prove this is my everyday. 
                    </p>
                <p>My research interests span the subjects of business, history, web development and general programming and I&rsquo;m interested in 
                    <em>productivity; living life to its fullest
                    </em>: in short, I love things that aim to better improve a person's life.
For instance, I have numerous projects in progress, all on different aspects of my interests.
                    </p>
                <p>I have taken several online courses as well as teaching myself new skills through friends, youtube and books, striving to implement what I learn into my everyday life.
During school I was affiliated with the following research groups:
                    </p>

                    <p>I really like music and sports and love to break the limits.Most people call me Prof; so feel free to too.</p>

I like to think this demonstrates by focus and commitment when I start something new and I applied the mixed skills of motivation, resilience and persistence. The rush of nerves before a race is a feeling I'll never get used to but, allows me to easily focus on the task ahead.</p>

Although I am no professional swimmer myself, my determination to be there for him, motivated him to give it everything he had. This was one of the first moments I truly understood the concept of time-management - I had to commit to waking up early and getting to the swimming pool, doing a swimming session, and walking to school in time for lessons.</p>

                <p>As a part of my marathon training which I am currently undertaking, on my two off days from running, I am cycling in order to keep my muscles loose due to the consistent tightening after a run. These cycles can range anywhere from 10k to 25k and help get the blood pumping without unnecessary efforts. I also cycle for fun with my sister on the afternoon of a morning run as it it her passion and being a part of what she loves makes us both happy</p>

I love the fact that it is an all girls team because it shows the universal passion for the sport and being able to support my little sister in such a way helps me as well as her - I need a calm, confident head, a weekly commitment and a good fitness level - another motivation to keep up the running.

                <p>I have now played guitar for six years and have achieved a distinction in every grade up to grade five, helping me develop interactional skills as well as patience to learn and improving my mechanical dexterity.

Luckily for me, we have a piano because my older sister has played since her childhood, and she was happy to help teach me. Since I have played guitar for so long, it was a new experience to play another instrument and learning the new techniques is as hard as everyone thinks!</p>

It is the post-apocalyptic genre and I am really enjoying the creating process so I cannot wait for that to be finalised.</p>
